## Description

This is a README generator program that would prompt you a bunch of questions to fill up.
At the end of it, it would generate you a new README file. 
I learned a lot about node and how it interacts through the terminal, I didn't know badges were a thing.


## Installation

if you'd like you can clone my repository but if you want to do the same way I did, get the starter code, install the inquirer json package and learn for yourself.

## Usage

go to your terminal and type in node index.js and answer the questions

## Credits

my instructors, my tutors and askbcs people.

## License

 

## Contribution
